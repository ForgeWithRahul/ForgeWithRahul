  <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? — Deep Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create
    systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making,
    understanding language, and recognizing patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI systems do not simply follow fixed instructions. Instead, they analyze data,
    learn from experience, and improve their performance over time. This ability
    to adapt and learn is what separates AI from traditional software.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Components of AI</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> AI systems require large amounts of data to learn patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Mathematical models that process data.</li>
    <li><strong>Computing Power:</strong> Hardware that enables fast processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-World Examples of AI</h3>
  <p>
    AI is already part of daily life. Search engines rank results using AI.
    Social media platforms detect fake accounts using AI.
    Banking systems detect fraud using AI-powered models.
  </p>

  <h3>Why AI is Transformational</h3>
  <p>
    AI increases efficiency, reduces human error, automates repetitive tasks,
    and enables innovation across industries such as healthcare, defense,
    finance, education, and cyber security.
  </p>

  <h2>What is Cyber Security? — Deep Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    Cyber Security is the discipline of protecting digital systems, networks,
    applications, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or attacks.
    As the world becomes more digitally connected, cyber threats are increasing
    in complexity and scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cyber Security is not just about hackers. It involves protecting personal data,
    business operations, government infrastructure, and national security.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Malware and Ransomware</li>
    <li>Phishing and Social Engineering</li>
    <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks</li>
    <li>Data breaches and insider threats</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Cyber Security is Critical</h3>
  <p>
    A single cyber attack can cause financial loss, data leaks, legal consequences,
    and loss of trust. Cyber Security ensures digital safety in an increasingly
    connected world.

  <h2>Relationship Between AI and Cyber Security</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security are deeply connected. AI enhances
    security systems by analyzing massive amounts of data and detecting threats
    in real time.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, Cyber Security protects AI systems from manipulation,
    data poisoning, and adversarial attacks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>AI-based threat detection</li>
    <li>Behavioral analysis of attackers</li>
    <li>Automated incident response</li>
    <li>Predictive cyber defense</li>
  </ul>
