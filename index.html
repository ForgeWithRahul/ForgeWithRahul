  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    ForgeWithRahul is a long-term knowledge platform dedicated to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    and Cyber Security. This website is designed for students, beginners, and professionals
    who want deep, structured, and practical understanding of modern technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike short tutorials or surface-level blogs, ForgeWithRahul focuses on strong foundations,
    real-world relevance, and future-ready skills that remain useful even after years.

  <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating
    intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    These tasks include learning from data, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making,
    understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI systems do not simply follow fixed instructions. Instead, they analyze large amounts
    of data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time. This ability to learn
    and adapt is what separates AI from traditional software.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Components of AI</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> AI systems require massive amounts of data to learn patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Mathematical models that process and analyze data.</li>
    <li><strong>Computing Power:</strong> Hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-World Examples of AI</h3>
  <p>
    AI is already deeply integrated into daily life. Search engines rank results using AI,
    social media platforms detect fake accounts, recommendation systems suggest videos and music,
    and banking systems use AI to detect fraud.
  </p>

  <h3>Why AI is Transformational</h3>
  <p>
    AI increases efficiency, reduces human error, automates repetitive tasks, and enables
    innovation across industries such as healthcare, defense, finance, education,
    and cyber security.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>

  <p>
    Cyber Security is the discipline of protecting digital systems, networks, applications,
    and data from unauthorized access, damage, or cyber attacks. As the world becomes more
    digitally connected, cyber threats are increasing in both complexity and scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cyber Security is not just about hackers. It involves protecting personal data,
    business operations, government infrastructure, and even national security.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Malware and Ransomware</li>
    <li>Phishing and Social Engineering</li>
    <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</li>
    <li>Data Breaches and Insider Threats</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Cyber Security is Critical</h3>
  <p>
    A single cyber attack can cause massive financial loss, data leaks, legal consequences,
    and loss of trust. Cyber Security ensures digital safety in an increasingly connected world.
  </p>

  <h2>Relationship Between AI and Cyber Security</h2>

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security are deeply interconnected. AI helps detect
    cyber threats faster by analyzing massive datasets and identifying unusual behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, attackers also use AI to launch more sophisticated attacks. This creates
    a constant battle where defenders must continuously innovate to stay ahead.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Scope</h2>

  <p>
    The future belongs to professionals who understand both AI and Cyber Security.
    Careers in these fields offer high demand, strong salaries, and global opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    ForgeWithRahul aims to grow as a trusted knowledge hub where learners can build skills
    that remain valuable for decades.
